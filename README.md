# O C School of Music

My goals in creating this website was to bring attention and gain business for a growing school of music. It was designed to be easy to use and to showcase some the types of courses the school has to offer. By creating the website it enables the school to reach out to a wider population and create a more substantial client base.

### Nav bar:

<img src="assets/images/navbar2.png">  

The nav bar has 3 different buttons, a home button to return to home page, a contact button that links straight to the contact page, the courses button links to a page with a preview of 4 different courses the school has to offer. It is the same across all pages and full responsive on all devices. 



## Home Page


### Landing Picture

<img src="assets/images/landingimage.png">

I picked a music sheet as a landing image for my site it appears in only the home page and is fully responive on all devices I think it conveys a music school quite well.

### About Section

<img src="assets/images/aboutsection.png">

In the about section it describes a little bit about the company and what kind of courses they have to offer. Things that  the user might be interested knowing, for example the shows they put on and what you can learn. There is also a video embeded and is of a band called Explosions in the sky and the song your hand in mine which I think demonstrates some good examples of of good quality music playing.


### Opening Times

<img src="assets/images/openingtimes.png">

The opening times section lets the user know of times that the school is open and when they are closed this can be updated for bank holidays, it has a yellow background and black color and stands out to the user.




### Footer 



<img src="assets/images/footer.png">

The footer contains a copyright message on the left hand side and has 4 social media links centered in the middle. Every link when clicked will open a new tab and direct the user to the relevent social media site. The footer apears on all pages in the site.


## Courses Page

The courses page is fully responsive and is a page that provides info on types of instruments, fees for courses and whether equipment will be needed there are 4 sections:

###  Drums

The contact page is made up of a simple form. It has a Name, Email, Message and Instrument fields all info is required for all fields except the message is optional. After submitting a request a thank you page appears conforming the submit.

## Design Features 

### Colors Used

I went for a yellow and black color design for my page I think the two contrast each other well.

<img src="assets/images/colors.png">

The two fonts used were Audiowide and Merriweather, I think they compliment each other well and the Audiowide font I think is an especially good font for a music site.

### Buttons 

<img src="assets/images/navhover.png">  <img src="assets/images/footerhover.png">

All buttons on both the nav bar and footer all have a hover feature and change color when hovered over.

## Manual Testing

 Testing was done using chrome dev tools:

 * Desktop 

  All pages responsive and tested good on desktop

* Ipad

  All pages responsive and tested good on ipad

* Iphone 

  All pages responsive and tested good on iphone

### Device testing

Tested on many devices and browsers. Android and Apple products all worked well and browsers like chrome and safari all tested good too. Using the am I responsive tool showed good reponsive layout on all devices.


## Bugs and Solutions

When testing on am I responsive the text for about us was pushed down into the opening times section.

The fix for the issue was to use a smaller font in the media queries for smaller screens.

## Deployment

Deployment was done as follows:

* In the Github repository click on the settings tab
* Scroll down to the new git hub pages section and click the link "check it out here"
* At the source section click the dropdown and pick main
* Then click save
* After you save it gives you a prompt that your git hub repository is ready to be published
* Then you just refresh the page and your live link is ready to share
