# O C School of Music

My goals in creating this website was to bring attention and gain business for a growing school of music. It was designed to be easy to use and to showcase some the types of courses the school has to offer. By creating the website it enables the school to reach out to a wider population and create a more substantial client base.

## Features of the Site

### Nav bar:

<img src="assets/images/navbar.png">

The nav bar has 4 different buttons, a home button to return to home page. A contact button that links straight to the contact section on the same page. The courses button links to a page with a preview of 4 different courses the school has to offer and the sign up page is a page to input info to query any course availability. It is the same across all pages and full responsive on all devices. I have since changed this nav bars background color to yellow to create more of a flow in the page. I also removed one of the 4 buttons and now just have a Home, Contact and Courses buttons.


## Home Page


### Landing Picture

I picked a music sheet as a landing image for my site it appears in only the home page and is fully responive on all devices I think it conveys a music school quite well.
